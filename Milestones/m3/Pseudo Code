the user their error message





** Pseudo Code **

Here is the pseudo code for the index page:

If we're in recursive mode {

    Validate the Username
        if not good {
            add a message to our error manager
        }

    Validate the Password
        if not good {
            add a message to our error manager
        }

    if the error manager has no errors {
        Log the person in
        Redirect
    }

}
