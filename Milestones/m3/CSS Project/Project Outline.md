# Milestone 3: CSS Project Outline

## Project Background and Description
Using the HTML and CSS skills you have acquired, follow the provided graphic design to create a static site. This site will have two main sections - the 'hero' div (top 1/3rd) and the 'primary-content' div (bottom 2/3rds). In the top section, you will create a logo that reads 'Puppy Love', a search field and button, a navigation bar, a header, and a brief 'welcome to our site' message. 

The bottom section will consist of three breakout content-boxes that overlap the top section a little, as well as another content-box that contains three images on the left with a brief description of the dog and six additional images on the right with a slightly different layout, as shown on the graphic design provided.
